    "We work as a consultant of <b>meal-kit delivery services</b> such as Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, and others in the US. We believe that there is a market to cater to people with a <b>specific diet</b>. These companies want to figure out which key metrics about a recipe makes people like it more. If we know how well people like a particular recipe, then we can expect more revenue for that recipe. From this work, we hope to answer the question:\n",
