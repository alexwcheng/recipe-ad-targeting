    "Our client is a <b>startup meal-kit delivery service</b> in competition with the likes of Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, and others in the US. The startup thinks that there is a market to cater to people with a <b>specific diet</b>. The leadership wants to figure out which key metrics about a recipe makes people like it more. If they know what people like about a recipe, then they can optimize those metrics, which hopefully leads to more popular recipes, and therefore more revenue. From this work, we hope to answer the question:\n",

    "- Recipe calories\n",
    "- Recipe preparation time\n",
