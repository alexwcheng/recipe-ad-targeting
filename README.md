### Project Scenario
The scenario for the project is as follows:

???

### Project Goals
The goals for the project are as follows:

   -  Based on our findings, we will provide at least 3 insights to figure out what predicts a "popular" recipe.
   -  We will arrive at these recommendations by analyzing data from Spoonacular. Spoonacular is a popular app for users to look up recipes by ingredient, by nutritional content, by price, and more. The Spoonacular API includes over 360,000 recipes as well as an open source recipe database.

### Methodology 
   -  Generate business application.
   -  Generate 3 questions related to the business application.
   -  Find and select a source of data to draw from and analyze (Spoonacular).
   -  Identify predictor and target variables to focus on.
   -  Generate criteria and call data from the API.
   -  Merge all API calls into one raw dataframe, and export to CSV.
   -  Clean data as needed.
   -  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate the data.
   -  Perform statistical testing on each of the 3 hypotheses.
   -  Generate linear regressions to fit the training data.
   -  Perform hyperparameter tuning on the models.
   -  Test models on the test data.
   -  Evaluate the ability of the model to predict our target variable (find R-Squared).
   -  Create a presentation to translate findings into actionable insights for business application.
